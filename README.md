## ✨ Features

- 📊 **Interactive Interface** – Real-time predictions using Streamlit.
- 🧠 **Ensemble Learning** – Combines multiple models for improved accuracy.
- 📂 **Real Dataset** – Uses `Salary_Data.csv` for training.
- 📈 **Model Comparison & Analysis** – Done via Jupyter Notebooks.
- 📥 **Accepts user input** – Age, Experience, Education, Job Title.
